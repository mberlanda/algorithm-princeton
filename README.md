# Princeton's Algorithms Course

This repository is inspired to [**Algorithms, Part I**](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partIhttps://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI) course of of Princeton University. More info can be found on the [homepage](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) of this course on Princeton University website.

I don't intend to provide the solutions of exercises or tests, but I want to replicate the approach used for Java algorithms in other programming languages (e.g. Ruby, Python).

I hope you enjoy and feel free to fork to add other algorithms or languages.

# Princeton's Algorithms Course

This repository is inspired to [**Algorithms, Part I**(https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partIhttps://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI) course of of Princeton University.

I don't intend to provide the solutions of the exercises of the test, but to replicate the approach used for Java algorithms in other programming languages (e.g. Ruby, Python).

I hope you enjoy and feel free to fork to add  other algorithms or  languages.
